This project demonstrates key concepts in Python exception handling. It includes three tasks: handling user input and dividing numbers safely, intentionally raising and managing common exceptions like IndexError, KeyError, and TypeError, and using try...except...else...finally blocks to structure error-handling logic. Each task is designed to build a solid understanding of writing resilient Python code. These scripts help ensure that programs fail gracefully and give meaningful feedback to users.
